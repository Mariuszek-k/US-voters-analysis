# US-voters-analysis

Dashboard tool for visual analysis of data and correlations between different features of voters. 

Description of dataset: Survey of 8000 US voters from 2016 that originally contains approximately 600 variables that describe their values, beliefs, demographics, voting record and everyday issues. For this project I selected 20 of these variables that include among others their support for political candidates, religious or smoking habits and demographics data. 

Dashboard can be opened by running .ipynb file in jupyter notebook and opening server that is created after compilation. Dataset file need to be put in parallel to .ipynd file.

Report with few insights and visual representation of dashboard can be found in .docx file.
